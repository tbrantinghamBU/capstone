    "# Week 1 Jupyter Notebook – Linear Regression 1\n",
    "Each week, you will apply the concepts of that week to your Integrated Capstone Project’s dataset. In preparation for Milestone One, create a Jupyter Notebook (similar to in Module B, semester two) that illustrates these lessons. There are no specific questions to answer in your Jupyter Notebook files in this course; your general goal is to analyze your data, using the methods you have learned about in this course and in this program, and draw interesting conclusions. \n",
    "\n",
    "For Week 1, include concepts such as linear regression with polynomial terms, interaction terms, multicollinearity, variance inflation factor and regression, and categorical and continuous features. Complete your Jupyter Notebook homework by 11:59 pm ET on Sunday. "
